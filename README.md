### DataTalks.Club Zoomcamp
This is my iteration of the final project propposed by the organizers of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp.
For those who eventually stumble upon this repository and are not aware, the Data Talks Club Engineering Zoomcamp is a nine week free bootcamp. More info on Data Talks Club on their [website](https://datatalks.club/). They have top notch teachers and courses, on different areas of data.
