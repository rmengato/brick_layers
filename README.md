# Final Project for DataTalks.club Data Engineering Zoomcamp

## Introduction

This is my iteration of the final project propposed by the organizers of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp.
For those who eventually stumble upon this repository and are not aware, the Data Talks Club Engineering Zoomcamp is a nine week free bootcamp. More info on Data Talks Club on their [website](https://datatalks.club/). They have top notch teachers and courses, on different areas of data. I highly recommend checking their work and have learned a lot troughout the course.

## Project guidelines and goals

The project guidelines are described on the course's [github](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/projects). They delineate minimum requirements, but allow the participant to choose their preferred tools and programming languages. 

## Pipeline Type

They also offer the possibility of chosing between batch and stream. For this project, **batch** pipelines will be created.

## Chosen tools for the project

Cloud Storage: **Google Cloud**

Data Warehouse: **Google BigQuery**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): **Terraform**

Workflow Orchestration: **Kestra**

Batch Processing: **PySpark** or **DBT** (to be defined)

### Ideally, a CI/CD tool will be used, as well as versioning and testing.
