# BrickLayers - A Brick Art Gallery database
### My Final Project for the 2025 DataTalks.club Data Engineering Zoomcamp

## Introduction

The project contained in this Github Repo aims to generate a database with data on famous art pieces and the toy brick pieces (such as Lego, for instance) necessary to build renditions of these famous paintings.

### DataTalks.Club Zoomcamp
This is my iteration of the final project propposed by the organizers of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp.
For those who eventually stumble upon this repository and are not aware, the Data Talks Club Engineering Zoomcamp is a nine week free bootcamp. More info on Data Talks Club on their [website](https://datatalks.club/). They have top notch teachers and courses, on different areas of data. I highly recommend checking their work and have learned a lot troughout the course.

### Usefulness

I wanted to deliever the project, but also make something interesting, but also that could make a positive impact at the same time. So here are some possible uses I can foresee for this database:

- Generating renditions of famous paintings, not only for Lego hobbyists
- For educators, to spark interest in art in others
- For interesting decoration. Fancy a copy of the "*Creation of Adam*" detail of the Sistine Chapel on your ceiling? Not in here (at least not this version yet, as I will use de Metropolitan Museum of New York API)

### Personal motivations
Firstly, a deep interest for the ways different areas of knowledge can intersect. Secondly, a newly found interest on how to convey useful information from the internet in different, preferably analogical, ways.

## The Project 

### Guidelines and goals

The project guidelines are described on the course's [github](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/projects). They delineate minimum requirements, but allow the participant to choose their preferred tools and programming languages. 

### Pipeline Type

They also offer the possibility of chosing between batch and stream. For this project, **batch** pipelines will be created.

### Chosen tools for the project

Cloud Storage: **Google Cloud**

Data Warehouse: **Google BigQuery**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): **Terraform**

Workflow Orchestration: **Kestra**

Batch Processing: **PySpark** or **DBT** (to be defined)

**Ideally, a CI/CD tool will be used, as well as versioning and testing.**

### Chosen Dataset

The chosen Dataset will be obtained from de Metropolitan Museum of
